In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using the `app` directory with dynamic routes and nested layouts.  If a layout attempts to access a route parameter that isn't defined in its parent route, a runtime error may occur silently, leading to unexpected behavior or a blank page. This is because Next.js's parameter handling in nested layouts may not consistently propagate parameters across all levels.
